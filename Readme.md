# SCIP Code Intelligence Protocol

SCIP (pronunciation: "skip") is a language-agnostic protocol
for indexing source code,
which can be used to power code navigation functionality
such as Go to definition, Find references, and Find implementations.

This repository includes:

- A [protobuf schema for SCIP](./scip.proto).
- Rich Go bindings for SCIP: This includes many utility functions
  to help build tooling on top of SCIP.
- Auto-generated bindings for TypeScript, Rust and Haskell.
- The [`scip` CLI](./docs/CLI.md) makes SCIP indexes
  a breeze to work with.

If you're interested in better understanding the motivation behind SCIP,
check out the [announcement blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip).

If you're interested in writing a new indexer that emits SCIP,
check out our documentation on
[how to write an indexer](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/writing_an_indexer).
Also, check out the [Debugging section][] in the Development docs.

If you're interested in consuming SCIP data,
you can either use one of the [provided language bindings](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip/tree/main/bindings),
or generate code for the [SCIP protobuf schema](./scip.proto)
using the protobuf toolchain for your language ecosystem.
Also, check out the [Debugging section][] in the Development docs.

## Tools using SCIP

Several indexers currently emit SCIP data:
[scip-java](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-java) (for Java, Kotlin and Scala),
[scip-typescript](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-typescript),
[scip-python](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-python),
[scip-ruby](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip-ruby) and
[rust-analyzer](https://github.com/sourcegraph/rust-analyzer).

For more details about indexers, including LSIF-based indexers,
see the [Sourcegraph documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_navigation/references/indexers).

Other tools which use SCIP include the [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli),
and the SCIP CLI in this repo.

## Installing the `scip` CLI

You can find binaries for the `scip` CLI tool [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip/releases).
You can also compile a binary locally using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip.git --depth=1
cd scip
go build -o scip ./cmd
```
