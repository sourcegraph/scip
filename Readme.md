# SCIP Code Intelligence Protocol

SCIP (pronounciation: "skip") is a language-agnostic protocol
for indexing source code,
which can be used to power code navigation functionality
such as Go to definition, Find references, and Find implementations.

This repository includes:

- A [protobuf schema for SCIP](./scip.proto).
- Rich Go bindings for SCIP: This includes many utility functions
  to help build tooling on top of SCIP.
- Auto-generated bindings for TypeScript, Rust and Haskell.
- The [`scip` CLI](#scip-cli-reference) makes SCIP indexes
  a breeze to work with.

If you're interested in better understanding the motivation behind SCIP,
check out the [announcement blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip).

If you're interested in writing a new indexer that emits SCIP,

[how to write an indexer](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/writing_an_indexer).
