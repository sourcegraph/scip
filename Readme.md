# SCIP Code Intelligence Protocol

SCIP (pronunciation: "skip") is a language-agnostic protocol
for indexing source code,
which can be used to power code navigation functionality
such as Go to definition, Find references, and Find implementations.

This repository includes:

- A [protobuf schema for SCIP](./scip.proto).
- Rich Go bindings for SCIP: This includes many utility functions
  to help build tooling on top of SCIP.
- Auto-generated bindings for TypeScript, Rust and Haskell.
- The [`scip` CLI](#scip-cli-reference) makes SCIP indexes
  a breeze to work with.

If you're interested in better understanding the motivation behind SCIP,
check out the [announcement blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-scip).

If you're interested in writing a new indexer that emits SCIP,
check out our documentation on
[how to write an indexer](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/writing_an_indexer).
Also, check out the [Debugging section][] in the Development docs.

If you're interested in consuming SCIP data,
you can either use one of the [provided language bindings](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip/tree/main/bindings),
or generate code for the [SCIP protobuf schema](./scip.proto)
using the protobuf toolchain for your language ecosystem.
Also, check out the [Debugging section][] in the Development docs.

   snapshot  Generate snapshot files for golden testing
   stats     Output useful statistics about a SCIP index
   help, h   Shows a list of commands or help for one command

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --help, -h     show help (default: false)
   --version, -v  Print the current version and exit. (default: false)
```

### `scip convert`

```
NAME:
   scip convert - Convert a SCIP index to an LSIF index

USAGE:
   scip convert [command options] [arguments...]
