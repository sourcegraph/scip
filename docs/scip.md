| Name                     | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **language**             | string            | The string ID for the programming language this file is written in. The `Language` enum contains the names of most common programming languages. This field is typed as a string to permit any programming langauge, including ones that are not specified by the `Language` enum. |
| **relative_path**        | string            | (Required) Unique path to the text document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| repeated **symbols**     | SymbolInformation | Symbols that are "defined" within this document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Additional notes on **relative_path**:

(Required) Unique path to the text document.

1. The path must be relative to the directory supplied in the associated
   `Metadata.project_root`.
2. The path must not begin with a leading '/'.
3. The path must point to a regular file, not a symbolic link.
4. The path must use '/' as the separator, including on Windows.
5. The path must be canonical; it cannot include empty components ('//'),
   or '.' or '..'.

Additional notes on **symbols**:

Symbols that are "defined" within this document.

This should include symbols which technically do not have any definition,
but have a reference and are defined by some other symbol (see
Relationship.is_definition).

### Index

Index represents a complete SCIP index for a workspace this is rooted at a
single directory. An Index message payload can have a large memory footprint
and it's therefore recommended to emit and consume an Index payload one field
value at a time. To permit streaming consumption of an Index payload, the
`metadata` field must appear at the start of the stream and must only appear
once in the stream. Other field values may appear in any order.

| Name                          | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| repeated **external_symbols** | SymbolInformation | (optional) Symbols that are referenced from this index but are defined in an external package (a separate `Index` message). Leave this field empty if you assume the external package will get indexed separately. If the external package won't get indexed for some reason then you can use this field to provide hover documentation for those external symbols. |

### Occurrence

Occurrence associates a source position with a symbol and/or highlighting
information.

If possible, indexers should try to bundle logically related information
across occurrences into a single occurrence to reduce payload sizes.

| repeated **range**                  | int32      | Source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four elements:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **syntax_kind**                     | SyntaxKind | (optional) What syntax highlighting class should be used for this range?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| repeated **diagnostics**            | Diagnostic | (optional) Diagnostics that have been reported for this specific range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **owner**                           | string     | (optional) The symbol name that this (reference) occurrence is scoped in e.g. if a function `foo` is called in `bar`, then that occurrence of the function call for `foo` will have its this field set to the full symbol name for `bar`.                                                                                                                    |

Additional notes on **range**:

Source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four
elements:

- Four elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endLine, endCharacter]`
- Three elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endCharacter]`. The end line
  is inferred to have the same value as the start line.

Line numbers and characters are always 0-based. Make sure to increment the
line/character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI because
editors conventionally use 1-based numbers.

Historical note: the original draft of this schema had a `Range` message
type with `start` and `end` fields of type `Position`, mirroring LSP.
Benchmarks revealed that this encoding was inefficient and that we could
reduce the total payload size of an index by 50% by using `repeated int32`
instead. The `repeated int32` encoding is admittedly more embarrassing to
work with in some programming languages but we hope the performance
improvements make up for it.

Additional notes on **override_documentation**:

(optional) CommonMark-formatted documentation for this specific range. If
empty, the `Symbol.documentation` field is used instead. One example
where this field might be useful is when the symbol represents a generic
function (with abstract type parameters such as `List<T>`) and at this
occurrence we know the exact values (such as `List<String>`).

This field can also be used for dynamically or gradually typed languages,
which commonly allow for type-changing assignment.

| **symbol**             | string |
| **is_reference**       | bool   | When resolving "Find references", this field documents what other symbols should be included together with this symbol. For example, consider the following TypeScript code that defines two symbols `Animal#sound()` and `Dog#sound()`: `ts interface Animal {           ^^^^^^ definition Animal#   sound(): string   ^^^^^ definition Animal#sound() } class Dog implements Animal {       ^^^ definition Dog#, implementation_symbols = Animal#   public sound(): string { return "woof" }          ^^^^^ definition Dog#sound(), references_symbols = Animal#sound(), implementation_symbols = Animal#sound() } const animal: Animal = new Dog()               ^^^^^^ reference Animal# console.log(animal.sound())                    ^^^^^ reference Animal#sound() ` Doing "Find references" on the symbol `Animal#sound()` should return references to the `Dog#sound()` method as well. Vice-versa, doing "Find references" on the `Dog#sound()` method should include references to the `Animal#sound()` method as well. |
| **is_implementation**  | bool   | Similar to `references_symbols` but for "Go to implementation". It's common for the `implementation_symbols` and `references_symbols` fields have the same values but that's not always the case. In the TypeScript example above, observe that `implementation_symbols` has the value `"Animal#"` for the "Dog#" symbol while `references_symbols` is empty. When requesting "Find references" on the "Animal#" symbol we don't want to include references to "Dog#" even if "Go to implementation" on the "Animal#" symbol should navigate to the "Dog#" symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **is_type_definition** | bool   | Similar to `references_symbols` but for "Go to type definition".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **is_definition**      | bool   | Allows overriding the behavior of "Go to definition" and "Find references" for symbols which do not have a definition of their own or could potentially have multiple definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Additional notes on **is_definition**:

Allows overriding the behavior of "Go to definition" and "Find references"
for symbols which do not have a definition of their own or could
potentially have multiple definitions.

For example, in a language with single inheritance and no field overriding,
inherited fields can reuse the same symbol as the ancestor which declares
the field. In such a situation, is_definition is not needed.

On the other hand, in languages with single inheritance and some form
of mixins, you can use is_definition to relate the symbol to the
matching symbol in ancestor classes, and is_reference to relate the
symbol to the matching symbol in mixins.

NOTE: At the moment, due to limitations of the SCIP to LSIF conversion,
only global symbols in an index are allowed to use is_definition.
The relationship may not get recorded if either symbol is local.

Update registerInverseRelationships on adding a new field here.

### Symbol

Symbol is similar to a URI, it identifies a class, method, or a local
variable. `SymbolInformation` contains rich metadata about symbols such as
the docstring.

Symbol has a standardized string representation, which can be used
interchangeably with `Symbol`. The syntax for Symbol is the following:

```
# (<x>)+ stands for one or more repetitions of <x>
<symbol>               ::= <scheme> ' ' <package> ' ' (<descriptor>)+ | 'local ' <local-id>
<package>              ::= <manager> ' ' <package-name> ' ' <version>
<scheme>               ::= any UTF-8, escape spaces with double space.
<manager>              ::= same as above, use the placeholder '.' to indicate an empty value
<package-name>         ::= same as above
<version>              ::= same as above
<descriptor>           ::= <namespace> | <type> | <term> | <method> | <type-parameter> | <parameter> | <meta>
<namespace>            ::= <name> '/'
<type>                 ::= <name> '#'
<term>                 ::= <name> '.'
<meta>                 ::= <name> ':'
<method>               ::= <name> '(' <method-disambiguator> ').'
<type-parameter>       ::= '[' <name> ']'
<parameter>            ::= '(' <name> ')'
<name>                 ::= <identifier>
<method-disambiguator> ::= <simple-identifier>
<identifier>           ::= <simple-identifier> | <escaped-identifier>
<simple-identifier>    ::= (<identifier-character>)+
<identifier-character> ::= '_' | '+' | '-' | '$' | ASCII letter or digit
<escaped-identifier>   ::= '`' (<escaped-character>)+ '`'
<escaped-characters>   ::= any UTF-8 character, escape backticks with double backtick.
```

The list of descriptors for a symbol should together form a fully
qualified name for the symbol. That is, it should serve as a unique
identifier across the package. Typically, it will include one descriptor
for every node in the AST (along the ancestry path) between the root of
the file and the node corresponding to the symbol.

| Name                     | Type       | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| **scheme**               | string     |
| **package**              | Package    |
| repeated **descriptors** | Descriptor |

### SymbolInformation

SymbolInformation defines metadata about a symbol, such as the symbol's
docstring or what package it's defined it.

| Name                       | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **symbol**                 | string       | Identifier of this symbol, which can be referenced from `Occurence.symbol`. The string must be formatted according to the grammar in `Symbol`.                                                                                                                                                    |
| repeated **documentation** | string       | (optional, but strongly recommended) The markdown-formatted documentation for this symbol. This field is repeated to allow different kinds of documentation. For example, it's nice to include both the signature of a method (parameters and return type) along with the accompanying docstring. |
| repeated **relationships** | Relationship | (optional) Relationships to other symbols (e.g., implements, type definition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Language

Language standardises names of common programming languages that can be used
for the `Document.language` field. The primary purpose of this enum is to
prevent a situation where we have a single programming language ends up with
multiple string representations. For example, the C++ language uses the name
"CPlusPlus" in this enum and other names such as "cpp" are incompatible.

### SymbolRole

SymbolRole declares what "role" a symbol has in an occurrence. A role is
encoded as a bitset where each bit represents a different role. For example,
to determine if the `Import` role is set, test whether the second bit of the
enum value is defined. In pseudocode, this can be implemented with the
logic: `const isImportRole = (role.value & SymbolRole.Import.value) > 0`.
