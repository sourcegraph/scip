| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **language**             | string            | The string ID for the programming language this file is written in. The `Language` enum contains the names of most common programming languages. This field is typed as a string to permit any programming language, including ones that are not specified by the `Language` enum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **relative_path**        | string            | (Required) Unique path to the text document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| repeated **occurrences** | Occurrence        | Occurrences that appear in this file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| repeated **symbols**     | SymbolInformation | Symbols that are "defined" within this document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **text**                 | string            | (optional) Text contents of the this document. Indexers are not expected to include the text by default. It's preferrable that clients read the text contents from the file system by resolving the absolute path from joining `Index.metadata.project_root` and `Document.relative_path`. This field was introduced to support `SymbolInformation.signature_documentation`, but it can be used for other purposes as well, for example testing or when working with virtual/in-memory documents. |
| **position_encoding**    | PositionEncoding  | Specifies the encoding used for source ranges in this Document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Additional notes on **relative_path**:

(Required) Unique path to the text document.

1. The path must be relative to the directory supplied in the associated
   `Metadata.project_root`.
2. The path must not begin with a leading '/'.
3. The path must point to a regular file, not a symbolic link.
4. The path must use '/' as the separator, including on Windows.
5. The path must be canonical; it cannot include empty components ('//'),
   or '.' or '..'.

Additional notes on **symbols**:

Symbols that are "defined" within this document.

This should include symbols which technically do not have any definition,
but have a reference and are defined by some other symbol (see
Relationship.is_definition).

Additional notes on **position_encoding**:

Specifies the encoding used for source ranges in this Document.

Usually, this will match the type used to index the string type
in the indexer's implementation language in O(1) time.

- For an indexer implemented in JVM/.NET language or JavaScript/TypeScript,
  use UTF16CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart.
- For an indexer implemented in Python,
  use UTF32CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart.
- For an indexer implemented in Go, Rust or C++,
  use UTF8ByteOffsetFromLineStart.

### Index

Index represents a complete SCIP index for a workspace this is rooted at a
single directory. An Index message payload can have a large memory footprint
and it's therefore recommended to emit and consume an Index payload one field
value at a time. To permit streaming consumption of an Index payload, the
`metadata` field must appear at the start of the stream and must only appear
once in the stream. Other field values may appear in any order.

| repeated **documents**        | Document          | Documents that belong to this index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| repeated **external_symbols** | SymbolInformation | (optional) Symbols that are referenced from this index but are defined in an external package (a separate `Index` message). Leave this field empty if you assume the external package will get indexed separately. If the external package won't get indexed for some reason then you can use this field to provide hover documentation for those external symbols. |

Additional notes on **external_symbols**:

(optional) Symbols that are referenced from this index but are defined in
an external package (a separate `Index` message). Leave this field empty
if you assume the external package will get indexed separately. If the
external package won't get indexed for some reason then you can use this
field to provide hover documentation for those external symbols.

IMPORTANT: When adding a new field to `Index` here, add a matching
function in `IndexVisitor` and update `ParseStreaming`.

| -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **version**                | ProtocolVersion | Which version of this protocol was used to generate this index?                                                                                                                                                |
| **tool_info**              | ToolInfo        | Information about the tool that produced this index.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **project_root**           | string          | URI-encoded absolute path to the root directory of this index. All documents in this index must appear in a subdirectory of this root directory.                                                               |
| **text_document_encoding** | TextEncoding    | Text encoding of the source files on disk that are referenced from `Document.relative_path`. This value is unrelated to the `Document.text` field, which is a Protobuf string and hence must be UTF-8 encoded. |

### Occurrence

Occurrence associates a source position with a symbol and/or highlighting
information.

If possible, indexers should try to bundle logically related information
across occurrences into a single occurrence to reduce payload sizes.

| Name                                | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **symbol_roles**                    | int32      | (optional) Bitset containing `SymbolRole`s in this occurrence. See `SymbolRole`'s documentation for how to read and write this field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Example applications that make use of the enclosing_range field:                                                                                                           |

Additional notes on **range**:

Half-open [start, end) range of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four
elements:

- Four elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endLine, endCharacter]`
- Three elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endCharacter]`. The end line
  is inferred to have the same value as the start line.

It is allowed for the range to be empty (i.e. start==end).

Line numbers and characters are always 0-based. Make sure to increment the
line/character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI because
editors conventionally use 1-based numbers.

The 'character' value is interpreted based on the PositionEncoding for
the Document.

Historical note: the original draft of this schema had a `Range` message
type with `start` and `end` fields of type `Position`, mirroring LSP.
Benchmarks revealed that this encoding was inefficient and that we could
reduce the total payload size of an index by 50% by using `repeated int32`
instead. The `repeated int32` encoding is admittedly more embarrassing to
work with in some programming languages but we hope the performance
improvements make up for it.

Additional notes on **override_documentation**:

(optional) CommonMark-formatted documentation for this specific range. If
empty, the `Symbol.documentation` field is used instead. One example
where this field might be useful is when the symbol represents a generic
function (with abstract type parameters such as `List<T>`) and at this
occurrence we know the exact values (such as `List<String>`).

This field can also be used for dynamically or gradually typed languages,
which commonly allow for type-changing assignment.

Additional notes on **enclosing_range**:

(optional) Using the same encoding as the sibling `range` field, half-open
source range of the nearest non-trivial enclosing AST node. This range must
enclose the `range` field. Example applications that make use of the
enclosing_range field:

- Call hierarchies: to determine what symbols are references from the body
  of a function
- Symbol outline: to display breadcrumbs from the cursor position to the
  root of the file
- Expand selection: to select the nearest enclosing AST node.
- Highlight range: to indicate the AST expression that is associated with a
  hover popover

For definition occurrences, the enclosing range should indicate the
start/end bounds of the entire definition AST node, including
documentation.

```
const n = 3
      ^ range
^^^^^^^^^^^ enclosing_range

/** Parses the string into something */
^ enclosing_range start --------------------------------------|
function parse(input string): string {                        |
         ^^^^^ range                                          |
    return input.slice(n)                                     |
}                                                             |
^ enclosing_range end <---------------------------------------|
```

Any attributes/decorators/attached macros should also be part of the
enclosing range.

```python
@cache
^ enclosing_range start---------------------|
def factorial(n):                           |
    return n * factorial(n-1) if n else 1   |
< enclosing_range end-----------------------|

```

For reference occurrences, the enclosing range should indicate the start/end
bounds of the parent expression.

```
const a = a.b
            ^ range
          ^^^ enclosing_range
const b = a.b(41).f(42).g(43)
                  ^ range
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ enclosing_range
```

| **symbol**             | string |
| **is_reference**       | bool   | When resolving "Find references", this field documents what other symbols should be included together with this symbol. For example, consider the following TypeScript code that defines two symbols `Animal#sound()` and `Dog#sound()`: `ts interface Animal {           ^^^^^^ definition Animal#   sound(): string   ^^^^^ definition Animal#sound() } class Dog implements Animal {       ^^^ definition Dog#, relationships = [{symbol: "Animal#", is_implementation: true}]   public sound(): string { return "woof" }          ^^^^^ definition Dog#sound(), references_symbols = Animal#sound(), relationships = [{symbol: "Animal#sound()", is_implementation:true, is_reference: true}] } const animal: Animal = new Dog()               ^^^^^^ reference Animal# console.log(animal.sound())                    ^^^^^ reference Animal#sound() ` Doing "Find references" on the symbol `Animal#sound()` should return references to the `Dog#sound()` method as well. Vice-versa, doing "Find references" on the `Dog#sound()` method should include references to the `Animal#sound()` method as well. |
| **is_implementation**  | bool   | Similar to `is_reference` but for "Find implementations". It's common for `is_implementation` and `is_reference` to both be true but it's not always the case. In the TypeScript example above, observe that `Dog#` has an `is_implementation` relationship with `"Animal#"` but not `is_reference`. This is because "Find references" on the "Animal#" symbol should not return "Dog#". We only want "Dog#" to return as a result for "Find implementations" on the "Animal#" symbol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **is_type_definition** | bool   | Similar to `references_symbols` but for "Go to type definition".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **is_definition**      | bool   | Allows overriding the behavior of "Go to definition" and "Find references" for symbols which do not have a definition of their own or could potentially have multiple definitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Additional notes on **is_definition**:

Allows overriding the behavior of "Go to definition" and "Find references"
for symbols which do not have a definition of their own or could
potentially have multiple definitions.

For example, in a language with single inheritance and no field overriding,
inherited fields can reuse the same symbol as the ancestor which declares
the field. In such a situation, is_definition is not needed.

On the other hand, in languages with single inheritance and some form
of mixins, you can use is_definition to relate the symbol to the
matching symbol in ancestor classes, and is_reference to relate the
symbol to the matching symbol in mixins.

NOTE: At the moment, due to limitations of the SCIP to LSIF conversion,
only global symbols in an index are allowed to use is_definition.
The relationship may not get recorded if either symbol is local.

Update registerInverseRelationships on adding a new field here.

### Symbol

Symbol is similar to a URI, it identifies a class, method, or a local
variable. `SymbolInformation` contains rich metadata about symbols such as
the docstring.

Symbol has a standardized string representation, which can be used
interchangeably with `Symbol`. The syntax for Symbol is the following:

```
# (<x>)+ stands for one or more repetitions of <x>
# (<x>)? stands for zero or one occurrence of <x>
<symbol>               ::= <scheme> ' ' <package> ' ' (<descriptor>)+ | 'local ' <local-id>
<package>              ::= <manager> ' ' <package-name> ' ' <version>
<scheme>               ::= any UTF-8, escape spaces with double space. Must not be empty nor start with 'local'
<manager>              ::= any UTF-8, escape spaces with double space. Use the placeholder '.' to indicate an empty value
<package-name>         ::= same as above
<version>              ::= same as above
<descriptor>           ::= <namespace> | <type> | <term> | <method> | <type-parameter> | <parameter> | <meta> | <macro>
<namespace>            ::= <name> '/'
<type>                 ::= <name> '#'
<term>                 ::= <name> '.'
<meta>                 ::= <name> ':'
<macro>                ::= <name> '!'
<method>               ::= <name> '(' (<method-disambiguator>)? ').'
<type-parameter>       ::= '[' <name> ']'
<parameter>            ::= '(' <name> ')'
<name>                 ::= <identifier>
<method-disambiguator> ::= <simple-identifier>
<identifier>           ::= <simple-identifier> | <escaped-identifier>
<simple-identifier>    ::= (<identifier-character>)+
<identifier-character> ::= '_' | '+' | '-' | '$' | ASCII letter or digit
<escaped-identifier>   ::= '`' (<escaped-character>)+ '`', must contain at least one non-<identifier-character>
<escaped-characters>   ::= any UTF-8, escape backticks with double backtick.
<local-id>             ::= <simple-identifier>
```

The list of descriptors for a symbol should together form a fully
qualified name for the symbol. That is, it should serve as a unique
identifier across the package. Typically, it will include one descriptor
for every node in the AST (along the ancestry path) between the root of
the file and the node corresponding to the symbol.

Local symbols MUST only be used for entities which are local to a Document,
and cannot be accessed from outside the Document.

| Name                     | Type       | Description |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| **scheme**               | string     |
| **package**              | Package    |
| repeated **descriptors** | Descriptor |

### SymbolInformation

SymbolInformation defines metadata about a symbol, such as the symbol's
docstring or what package it's defined it.

| Name                        | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **symbol**                  | string       | Identifier of this symbol, which can be referenced from `Occurence.symbol`. The string must be formatted according to the grammar in `Symbol`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| repeated **documentation**  | string       | (optional, but strongly recommended) The markdown-formatted documentation for this symbol. Use `SymbolInformation.signature_documentation` to document the method/class/type signature of this symbol. Due to historical reasons, indexers may include signature documentation in this field by rendering markdown code blocks. New indexers should only include non-code documentation in this field, for example docstrings.             |
| repeated **relationships**  | Relationship | (optional) Relationships to other symbols (e.g., implements, type definition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **kind**                    | Kind         | The kind of this symbol. Use this field instead of `SymbolDescriptor.Suffix` to determine whether something is, for example, a class or a method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **display_name**            | string       | (optional) The name of this symbol as it should be displayed to the user. For example, the symbol "com/example/MyClass#myMethod(+1)." should have the display name "myMethod". The `symbol` field is not a reliable source of the display name for several reasons:                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **signature_documentation** | Document     | (optional) The signature of this symbol as it's displayed in API documentation or in hover tooltips. For example, a Java method that adds two numbers this would have `Document.language = "java"` and `Document.text = "void add(int a, int b)". The `language`and`text`fields are required while other fields such as`Documentation.occurrences` can be optionally included to support hyperlinking referenced symbols in the signature. |
| **enclosing_symbol**        | string       | (optional) The enclosing symbol if this is a local symbol. For non-local symbols, the enclosing symbol should be parsed from the `symbol` field using the `Descriptor` grammar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Additional notes on **display_name**:

(optional) The name of this symbol as it should be displayed to the user.
For example, the symbol "com/example/MyClass#myMethod(+1)." should have the
display name "myMethod". The `symbol` field is not a reliable source of
the display name for several reasons:

- Local symbols don't encode the name.
- Some languages have case-insensitive names, so the symbol is all-lowercase.
- The symbol may encode names with special characters that should not be
  displayed to the user.

Additional notes on **enclosing_symbol**:

(optional) The enclosing symbol if this is a local symbol. For non-local
symbols, the enclosing symbol should be parsed from the `symbol` field
using the `Descriptor` grammar.

The primary use-case for this field is to allow local symbol to be displayed
in a symbol hierarchy for API documentation. It's OK to leave this field
empty for local variables since local variables usually don't belong in API
documentation. However, in the situation that you wish to include a local
symbol in the hierarchy, then you can use `enclosing_symbol` to locate the
"parent" or "owner" of this local symbol. For example, a Java indexer may
choose to use local symbols for private class fields while providing an
`enclosing_symbol` to reference the enclosing class to allow the field to
be part of the class documentation hierarchy. From the perspective of an
author of an indexer, the decision to use a local symbol or global symbol
should exclusively be determined whether the local symbol is accessible
outside the document, not by the capability to find the enclosing
symbol.

#### Kind

(optional) Kind represents the fine-grained category of a symbol, suitable for presenting
information about the symbol's meaning in the language.

For example:

- A Java method would have the kind `Method` while a Go function would
  have the kind `Function`, even if the symbols for these use the same
  syntax for the descriptor `SymbolDescriptor.Suffix.Method`.
- A Go struct has the symbol kind `Struct` while a Java class has
  the symbol kind `Class` even if they both have the same descriptor:
  `SymbolDescriptor.Suffix.Type`.

Since Kind is more fine-grained than Suffix:

- If two symbols have the same Kind, they should share the same Suffix.
- If two symbols have different Suffixes, they should have different Kinds.

### Language

Language standardises names of common programming languages that can be used
for the `Document.language` field. The primary purpose of this enum is to
prevent a situation where we have a single programming language ends up with
multiple string representations. For example, the C++ language uses the name
"CPP" in this enum and other names such as "cpp" are incompatible.
Feel free to send a pull-request to add missing programming languages.

### PositionEncoding

Encoding used to interpret the 'character' value in source ranges.

| Number | Name                             | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | UnspecifiedPositionEncoding      | Default value. This value should not be used by new SCIP indexers so that a consumer can process the SCIP index without ambiguity. |
| 1      | UTF8CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart  | The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms of UTF-8 code units (i.e. bytes).                                       |
| 2      | UTF16CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart | The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms of UTF-16 code units (each is 2 bytes).                                 |
| 3      | UTF32CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart | The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms of UTF-32 code units (each is 4 bytes).                                 |

Additional notes on **UTF8CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart**:

The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms
of UTF-8 code units (i.e. bytes).

Example: For the string "🚀 Woo" in UTF-8, the bytes are
[240, 159, 154, 128, 32, 87, 111, 111], so the offset for 'W'
would be 5.

Additional notes on **UTF16CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart**:

The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms
of UTF-16 code units (each is 2 bytes).

Example: For the string "🚀 Woo", the UTF-16 code units are
['\ud83d', '\ude80', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'o'], so the offset for 'W'
would be 3.

Additional notes on **UTF32CodeUnitOffsetFromLineStart**:

The 'character' value is interpreted as an offset in terms
of UTF-32 code units (each is 4 bytes).

Example: For the string "🚀 Woo", the UTF-32 code units are
['🚀', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'o'], so the offset for 'W' would be 2.

### SymbolRole

SymbolRole declares what "role" a symbol has in an occurrence. A role is
encoded as a bitset where each bit represents a different role. For example,
to determine if the `Import` role is set, test whether the second bit of the
enum value is defined. In pseudocode, this can be implemented with the
logic: `const isImportRole = (role.value & SymbolRole.Import.value) > 0`.

Additional notes on **ForwardDefinition**:

Is this a signature for a symbol that is defined elsewhere?

Applies to forward declarations for languages like C, C++
and Objective-C, as well as `val` declarations in interface
files in languages like SML and OCaml.
